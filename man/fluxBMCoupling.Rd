Resets the absolute flux bounds of reactions proportional to the flux through
the biomass reaction.

\details{
The idea of flux coupling in flux balance models of multi-species communities
was first introduced by Heinken et al. (2013). The idea is to limit the
reactions fluxes in order to prevent that a reaction in one organism is
solely used (i.e., carries a non-zero flux) to benefit another organism in
the community and not the organism that produced the enzyme for the specific
reaction. Therefore, new linear constraints are added to the flux balance
model where the absolute reaction flux bounds of organism \emph{j} is proportional
to the biomass formation of organism \emph{j}. The coupling constraints are
defined as:

\deqn{-c v_{b,j} - u \leq v_{i,j} \leq c v_{b,j} + u}

where \eqn{v_{i,j}} is the flux through reaction \emph{i} in organism \emph{j},
\eqn{v_{b,j}} the biomass reaction of organism \emph{j}. \emph{c} and \emph{u} are
parameters for the coupling constraints that define intercept (\emph{u}) and slope
(\emph{c}) (see figure).
